        <H1>I LOVE FOOD</H1>
        <p>I love food as much as anybody does! Even though some food might not be as good as others, I love the food non the less. Even though I might be as skinny as a pen I love food, and I'd like to see someone try to challenge me. In my oppinion, I think I'm a food connoisseur! I love my moms cooking so much I'd rather eat it more than to go out and eat at a restaurant because I love her cooking that much! I recommend that you should eat your moms cooking or try to help her cook, or just try cooking her a meal! Other than that I really love my mom and she deserves all the appreciation in the world!</p>
